# Azure OpenAI Service Setup and Usage Tutorial with Python (GPT-3)

This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up and using Azure OpenAI Service with Python, specifically focusing on GPT-3.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Azure subscription

## Step 1: Explore Azure OpenAI capabilities with GPT-3 Playground

Start exploring Azure OpenAI capabilities with a no-code approach through the GPT-3 Playground. It's a text box where you can submit a prompt to generate a completion. From this page, you can quickly iterate and experiment with the capabilities. You can select a deployment and choose from a few pre-loaded examples to get started.

You can access the GPT-3 Playground [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quickstart).

## Step 2: Learn about Azure OpenAI's powerful language models

Learn how to use Azure OpenAI's powerful language models, including GPT-3, Codex, and Embeddings model series, for content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation.

You can find detailed documentation and examples on how to use Azure OpenAI's language models [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/).

## Step 3: Understand Azure OpenAI Service models

Azure OpenAI Service is powered by a diverse set of models with different capabilities and price points. Model availability may vary by region. For information about GPT-3 and other models retiring in July 2024, refer to the Azure OpenAI Service legacy models documentation.

You can learn more about Azure OpenAI Service models [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models).

## Step 4: Fine-tuning with Azure OpenAI Service

You can now use Azure OpenAI Service or Azure Machine Learning to fine-tune Babbage/Davinci-002 and GPT-3.5-Turbo models. Babbage-002 and Davinci-002 support completion, while Turbo supports conversational interactions. You can specify your base model, provide your data, train, and deploy with a few commands.

For more information on fine-tuning with Azure OpenAI Service, refer to the official documentation [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai-services-blog/fine-tuning-now-available-with-azure-openai-service/ba-p/3954693).

Please note that the actual steps and code examples may vary depending on your specific use case and requirements.
