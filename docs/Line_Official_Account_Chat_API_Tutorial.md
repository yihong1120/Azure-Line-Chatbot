Sure! Here is a tutorial on how to apply for and use the LINE official account chat API in Markdown format:

## LINE Official Account Chat API Application and Usage Tutorial

To get started with the LINE Messaging API, you first need to create a channel. You can either create this channel on the LINE Developers Console or add it to an existing LINE Official Account. Below are the steps for both methods:

### Creating a Channel on the LINE Developers Console

1. Log in to the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/).
2. Register as a developer (only on first login).
3. Create a new provider.
4. Create a channel in the Channels tab of the provider page you created.
5. Enter the required information for your channel.

### Adding a Channel to Your Existing LINE Official Account

1. Go to the [LINE Official Account Manager](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/) and enable the Messaging API.
2. Enable the use of the Messaging API in the LINE Official Account Manager.
3. Log in to the LINE Developers Console with the same account as your LINE Official Account Manager.
4. Confirm that a channel has been created.

Now that the channel has been created, you are ready to use the Messaging API. You can refer to the [Messaging API overview](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/overview/) for basic knowledge of the LINE Official Account and how to build bots using the Messaging API.

To share your LINE Official Account with users and increase the number of followers, you can use the following methods:

1. Share the QR code of your LINE Official Account.
2. Share the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account.
3. Add an "Add Friend" button or link to your app or website.
4. Encourage users to recommend your LINE Official Account to friends on LINE.
5. Prompt users to add your LINE Official Account when logging in with LINE Login.

For more detailed instructions on how to implement these methods, you can refer to the [Sharing Your LINE Official Account](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/sharing-bot/) documentation.

Finally, if you want to engage in interactive conversations with LINE users, you can use the [Messaging API](https://developers.line.biz/en/services/messaging-api/). This API allows you to develop two-way communication between your service and LINE users.
